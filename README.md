# Covid19_detection
Detecting covid19 from X-ray images using VGG16, mobilenet, CNN
1. To train the model follow the jupiter notebook Final(2).ipynb
2. The dataset was a combination of datasets.
3. The normal images were taken from the Kaggle pnemonia dataset.
4. The covid19 images were taken from https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset.
5. A GUI was made where you can upload the image and the image will be classified either covid positive or negative.
6. Run the .py files where you get a gui to upload the images and check.
7. The pre-trained model is stored in model_cnn.h5
8. covid19_data folder contains the test and train dataset.
